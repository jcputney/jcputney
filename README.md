ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ VP, Technology | ðŸŽ¯ 20+ years of experience | ðŸ§  Strategic architect & hands-on builder

Iâ€™m currently leading development at a SaaS company focused on enterprise learning platforms, with a strong emphasis on security, scalability, and real-time performance. I specialize in:
- Jakarta EE (WildFly, JPA, MVC)

- Custom-built platforms:
  - A distributed Job Scheduler built for Jakarta EE
  - A modern SCORM client-side runtime
  - A modular file upload library (Upwrd) with S3 integration

I care about clean architecture, reliable infrastructure, and solutions that scaleâ€”without BS.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Java, TypeScript, SQL
- AWS (Lambda, S3, CloudFront, Aurora, IAM, CloudWatch)
- MCP-compatible AI tooling for documentation/testing
- CI/CD, automation, and serverless-first design

ðŸ’¡ Currently focused on:
- Achieving SOC 2 Type 2 via smart automation (no vendor lock-in)
- Launching a scalable AI-moderation API
